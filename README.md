# Drainage and sedimentary responses to dynamic topography, [**GRL**](https://doi.org/10.1029/2019GL084400) 

## Overview

Increasing evidence suggests that dynamic topography associated with mantle flow contributes to shaping Earthâ€™s evolving landscapes by interacting with surface processes and can potentially be documented in the geological record. However, the relatively low amplitude and long wavelength nature of dynamic topography increase the difficulty of extracting it from the sedimentary record on the sole basis of field observations.

Our study uses the landscape evolution model [**Badlands**](https://github.com/badlands-model/pyBadlands) as a numerical tool to investigate the contribution of dynamic topography to continental-scale drainage evolution and the formation of stratigraphic architecture at passive continental margins. 

Our analysis of the evolution of drainage systems in response to propagating waves of negative and positive dynamic topography indicates that dynamic uplift produces drainage reorganization while dynamic subsidence leads to marine inundation with no readjustment of drainage networks. The resulting flow rerouting is short-lived if drainage systems experience transient uplift followed by transient subsidence. Drainage reorganizations induced by dynamic topography lead to significant variations in sediment supply and offshore deposition. With known sea level change and thermal subsidence history, the footprint of dynamic topography can be predicted and observed from stratal stacking transitions and shoreline and depocenter migrations.
